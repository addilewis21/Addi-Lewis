# My ReadMe
I'm Addi and I'm in my third year at UVU. I love design but I like knowing how things work so I'm glad to be in devleopment classes 
and learning more about creating the websites themselves. I am interested in learning more about javascript and adding more interesting elements to my pages.
I'm working on building out my portfolio right now and am looking at a few side projects. I love to watch movies, do puzzles and crochet!
